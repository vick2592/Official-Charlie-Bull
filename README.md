## AI Server Proxy

The frontend calls internal API routes which proxy to the external Charlie AI server.

- Configure the backend URL via `.env.local` (not checked into git):

```
AI_SERVER_URL=<YOUR_AI_SERVER_URL>
```

- Routes (App Router):
  - `GET /api/healthz` ‚Üí proxies to `${AI_SERVER_URL}/healthz`
  - `POST /api/chat` ‚Üí proxies to `${AI_SERVER_URL}/v1/chat`

Notes:
- We preserve upstream status codes and return `application/json`.
- Timeouts: 10s for health, 15s for chat.
- Do not prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`; the URL stays server-side only.
